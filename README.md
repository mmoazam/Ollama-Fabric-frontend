## Can I get ChatGpt to write a java swing app?

I have Ollama and Fabric on my Windows 11 desktop. Seemed Like a good place to start. 
The application needed to get user input, in this case I wanted a YouTube video transcript URL.
Then a way to select the Fabric Pattern and Model. Then Run a command made of Input URL, Model and Fabric Pattern.
At the moment the input is using a yt, which is a command to get the transcript from YouTube. This will be updated to include other ways of piping
commands into fabric.

Finally, I wanted to see the output in a Text area.

Just by prompting ChatGpt I was able to build a front end for Fabric. I didn't have to write any code.
In fact, I didn't even read the code. But I got the result I wanted.

## What is Ollama and what is Fabric?

### What is Ollama?
See here https://ollama.com/ .  
Ollama is now available on Windows in preview, 
making it possible to pull, run and create large language models in a new native Windows experience. 
Ollama on Windows includes built-in GPU acceleration, access to the full model library, and the Ollama API including OpenAI compatibility.

### What is Fabric?
see here https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/tree/main
Since the start of 2023 and GenAI we've seen a massive number of AI applications for accomplishing tasks. It's powerful, but it's not easy to integrate this functionality into our lives.
In other words, AI doesn't have a capabilities problemâ€”it has an integration problem.

Fabric was created to address this by enabling everyone to granularly apply AI to everyday challenges.
Philosophy

    AI isn't a thing; it's a magnifier of a thing. And that thing is human creativity.

We believe the purpose of technology is to help humans flourish, so when we talk about AI we start with the human problems we want to solve.
